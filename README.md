# Stock-analysis
## Overview of Project
Steve is a finance degree graduate with his parents as his first clients. His parents want to invest in green energy and have chosen one specifically to invest in and want Steve's expertise to see if they have made the right decision. We have been given data for a variety of different green energy stocks performance. 
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to help Steve by analyzing the expanded data to include all the stock market data for the past few years to see how all the energy saving stocks have performed.
